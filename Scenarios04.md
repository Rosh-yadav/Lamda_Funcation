1. **Automate File Processing:**
   - **Scenario:** Automatically process images uploaded to S3.
   - **Use Case:** Resize images or generate thumbnails when a new image is uploaded.
   - **Why:** Saves time and effort by automating repetitive tasks.

2. **Run Background Jobs:**
   - **Scenario:** Process data or perform tasks in the background.
   - **Use Case:** Perform data analysis or send notifications after a user action.
   - **Why:** Keeps the main application fast and responsive by handling tasks asynchronously.

3. **Serverless Web Backend:**
   - **Scenario:** Handle HTTP requests for a web application.
   - **Use Case:** Respond to API requests from a mobile app or website.
   - **Why:** Allows you to run code without managing servers, reducing complexity.

4. **Event-Driven Workflows:**
   - **Scenario:** Trigger actions based on events.
   - **Use Case:** Execute a function when a new record is added to a database.
   - **Why:** Ensures real-time processing based on specific triggers.

5. **Chatbot Integration:**
   - **Scenario:** Process user messages in a chatbot.
   - **Use Case:** Analyze and respond to user inputs in a chat application.
   - **Why:** Automates responses and enhances user interaction.

6. **Scheduled Tasks:**
   - **Scenario:** Perform routine tasks on a schedule.
   - **Use Case:** Back up data or run maintenance tasks periodically.
   - **Why:** Automates regular tasks without manual intervention.

### **Expert-Level Knowledge**

1. **Automate File Processing:**
   - **Scenario:** Use Lambda functions triggered by S3 events to process uploaded files.
   - **Use Case:** Execute image processing operations, such as format conversion or resizing, using AWS SDKs and third-party libraries.
   - **Why:** Ensures real-time file processing with minimal overhead and without server management.

2. **Run Background Jobs:**
   - **Scenario:** Implement Lambda functions to handle asynchronous tasks from AWS Step Functions or event-driven architectures.
   - **Use Case:** Execute data transformations or complex workflows triggered by user interactions or other events.
   - **Why:** Achieves high scalability and fault tolerance for background job execution with minimal latency.

3. **Serverless Web Backend:**
   - **Scenario:** Create RESTful APIs with AWS API Gateway integrated with Lambda functions.
   - **Use Case:** Handle API requests and manage state or session information without dedicated server infrastructure.
   - **Why:** Reduces operational overhead, leverages auto-scaling, and provides cost-efficient scaling based on demand.

4. **Event-Driven Workflows:**
   - **Scenario:** Configure Lambda to be invoked by AWS CloudWatch Events or Amazon EventBridge to react to state changes or system events.
   - **Use Case:** Implement complex event-driven workflows such as orchestrating multiple services or integrating with AWS services like DynamoDB Streams.
   - **Why:** Facilitates scalable and decoupled architectures, enhancing the system's resilience and responsiveness.

5. **Chatbot Integration:**
   - **Scenario:** Use Lambda functions in conjunction with Amazon Lex to process and respond to natural language inputs.
   - **Use Case:** Implement business logic and integration with other AWS services to handle user interactions and provide dynamic responses.
   - **Why:** Enables intelligent, serverless chat interactions and leverages machine learning capabilities for improved user engagement.

6. **Scheduled Tasks:**
   - **Scenario:** Configure Lambda functions to run on a regular schedule using Amazon CloudWatch Events.
   - **Use Case:** Perform data aggregation, scheduled reports, or system health checks at predefined intervals.
   - **Why:** Ensures reliable and cost-effective scheduling of tasks without managing dedicated infrastructure.
